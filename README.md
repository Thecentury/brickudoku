A terminal interface for Brickudoku game â€” a hybrid of Sudoku and Tetris.

Built on top of the [brick](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick) library which makes building terminal user interfaces very accessible. Sam Tay also has a nice [tutorial](https://samtay.github.io/posts/introduction-to-brick) that can help you get started.

## Installlation

#### Install from source

First [get stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/#how-to-install). Then
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thecentury/brickudoku.git
cd brickudoku
stack build
# run using stack
stack run
# alternatively, copy the executable to ~/.local/bin
stack install brickudoku
brickudoku
```

Windows support is unfortunately questionable.

## Usage

Run the game by simply executing the `brickudoku` command.

## To-do

- [ ] (Cheating) Highlight regions where a figure can be placed
- [ ] Video of the gameplay in the readme
